"""Boot warm-up: builds the cold storage-engine indexes at WAKE.

A cold storage engine pays a per-process index-build cost the first time it
sees each distinct query shape (an ANN candidate fetch, the resident
exact-cosine matrix, an events scan, a corpus COUNT, a paired edge fetch).
Left alone, that cost lands on the user's first real recall. This module
fires those same query shapes once, read-only, as a background task right
after the socket comes up, so the indexes are already warm by the time a
real recall arrives.

Nothing here goes through the record write/dispatch path — no reinforcement
is queued, no event is written, nothing is captured. Side effects are the
diagnostics sidecar and the explicit plaintext lexical-index sidecar.

Fail-safe: any exception while probing one shape is recorded and the
remaining shapes still run; an empty or degenerate corpus is a no-op, not a
crash. Set IAI_MCP_BOOT_WARMUP_OFF=1 to skip entirely.
